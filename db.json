As such, this book explores how corporate and financial social responsibility can leverage intergenerational harmony. The concept of responsibility is shown to underlie the international emergence of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), while the book also describes the rise of Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) in the international arena and the intrinsic socio-psychological motives of socially responsible investors. As shown here, in this age of climate change, over-indebtedness and demographic aging, future corporate and financial intergenerational leadership may continue to embrace social responsibility in order to ensure a sustainable future for humankind.",
