      <p>
        Hey there! 👋 Welcome to this little book-hunting space we built.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a simple project where you can look up books, save your favourites, and keep track of ones you love (or plan to read eventually... no judgment 😅).
      </p>
      <p>
        What you can do here:
        <ul>
          <li>🔍 Search for books by title</li>
          <li>⭐ Add and remove favourites</li>
          <li>📚 See a curated collection</li>
          <li>🖼️ Click on books to see more details</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s built with React, a dash of Bootstrap, and a bunch of trial & error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still adding stuff as we go — hope you enjoy exploring! 💻📖
